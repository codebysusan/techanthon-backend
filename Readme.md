Our local port is running in 5000

We have followed MVC structure in our project
 SQL database is used.

 We have used routes and controllers for implmenting apis

 Controllers contains the business logic and routes contain the path for apis

 We have used JWT authentication for login and singup and middleware is also created using JWT token

 Without authentication no routes can be accessible

 There is separate admin and user login and signup functionality implemented

 Tables are creaeting in MySQL using scripts and not through any model or migrations.

 We have used raw sql queries and not any ORM
